# **Week 5 – Delivery**

### *Introduction to Public Speaking (Coursera)*

Week 5 was all about **DELIVERY** — the stage where everything comes together.
This week taught me how to transform a well-written speech into a **powerful performance** using voice, expressions, presence, and connection.


## **📌 Key Learnings**

### **1. The Role of Delivery**

* Delivery is not separate from content — it *enhances* content.
* A good message becomes memorable only when delivered clearly and confidently.
* Connection with the audience happens through tone, pace, and authenticity.


### **2. Verbal Delivery**

* Use **pauses** to create impact and give listeners time to absorb.
* Maintain a natural **speaking pace** — not too fast, not too slow.
* Adjust **volume** to suit the environment and emotion.
* Emphasize key words by slightly changing tone or energy.


### **3. Non-Verbal Delivery**

* **Eye contact** builds trust and holds audience attention.
* **Facial expressions** should match the emotions of the story.
* **Gestures** must be purposeful — not distracting.
* **Posture** communicates confidence before you even speak.

### **4. Internal & External Confidence**

* Internal confidence comes from **preparation** and knowing your material.
* External confidence comes from **practice**, breathing, and staying grounded.
* Don’t try to be perfect — try to be **present**.

### **5. Practicing Delivery**

* Record yourself to understand your natural habits.
* Notice filler words, unnecessary movements, or monotone speech.
* Practice with a calm breath and clear intention.
* Use storytelling, emotion, and simplicity to connect deeply


## **🎤 Week 5 Assignment – Final Speech**

Title: **“The Power of Listening: Why Listening Is More Important Than Speaking”**

This week’s assignment was **peer-graded**, which made it even more valuable.
I delivered a real-life, story-driven speech combining lessons from childhood, parenting, marriage, friendships, and a transformative workshop experience.

Peers appreciated:

* My calm tone
* Emotional storytelling
* Authentic examples
* Strong connection with the audience

This assignment helped me grow the most in my delivery skills.


## **✨ Reflection**

Week 5 taught me that delivery is not acting — it is **alignment** between your mind, message, and heart.

Great speakers are not the loudest…
They are the most **genuine**, **present**, and **connected**.

This week completed my foundation in public speaking, and I look forward to applying these skills in real conversations, videos, and future speeches.
