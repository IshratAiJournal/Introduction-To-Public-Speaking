### 2. What is Rhetoric?
- Rhetoric is the art of identifying communication needs and strategically responding to them.
- Public speaking involves responding effectively to rhetorical situations, which include: topic, setting, audience, occasion, and your credibility.
- There is no single approach that always works; developing skills, experience, and judgment is key.

3. **Style:** Choosing effective language.
4. **Memory:** Memorizing to support good delivery.

### 4. Speech as a Medium
- **Speech differs from writing:**
  - Language is acquired; writing is learned.
  - Language evolved; writing was invented.
  - Language is ubiquitous; writing is not.
- Don’t treat writing as speaking; write speeches **for the ear, not the eye**.

### 5. How We Talk
- Speaking involves moving between conceptualization, formulation, and articulation.
- Listening involves perceiving, decoding, and predicting.
- Listeners need cues to decode speech quickly and easily.
