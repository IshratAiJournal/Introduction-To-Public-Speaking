# 📚 Week 2 – Public Speaking Course (Coursera)

## 🎯 **Theme of the Week:**  
**Understanding Audience & Handling Q&A Sessions**


## ✅ **Key Learnings**

### 🧠 1. Importance of Knowing Your Audience
- A speech becomes effective only when it connects emotionally and mentally with the listeners.  
- To tailor your speech for the audience, ask yourself:
  - *Who are they? (age, interests, background)*
  - *Why are they here? (expectations, motivation)*
  - *What do they already know about my topic?*
  - *What do I want them to think or do after my speech?*


### 🎤 2. Structuring the Q&A Session
- Q&A is not the end of the speech—it’s a **continuation of your message**.
- You must:
  - Listen calmly.  
  - Respond clearly and respectfully.  
  - Stay focused on the main message.

### 💡 3. Techniques to Handle Tough or Uncomfortable Questions
| Technique | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bridging** | Guide the answer back to your main message. |
| **Flagging** | Highlight the most important part of your answer. |
| **Correcting** | Politely correct misinformation or false assumptions. |
| **Rejecting Loaded Words** | Refuse to accept unfair or biased terms in the question. |
